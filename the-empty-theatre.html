    <h2>The Empty Theatre</h2>
    <p>I like empty theatres, before the cast, the crew and the audience arrive. The gathering of chairs assembled to take in the majestic stage. The lights, poised to illuminate the magic as it happens.</p>

<p>There’s an eeriness to the feeling of walking down the aisle, footsteps on the carpet mutedly echoing around the vast empty space in which people will later experience another world. Arriving at the stage the clicks of my shoes resonate off the lofty ceiling as I climb the seven wooden steps to the apron.</p>

<p>Turning to face my ghostly audience I pause to take in the epic sight. Hundreds of potential eyes watch me clickety-clack across the stage, my gaze drawn travelling from the blaconies on the left, across the upper circle, and down to the balconies on the right, all perfectly framing the bulk of my admiring fans.</p>

<p>I look up to find a complex web of metal poles, lattice structures, and wires for miles. There are more poised lights here, of all shapes and sizes, with coloured plastic attached to their faces promising a spectrum of moods. I trace a particularly intricate web of wires across and down to one side of the stage, where it ends as a rope with rubber grips. A harness, and a promise of some Peter Pan action later.</p>

<p>There’s a red light glowing in the dark recesses of that side of the stage. I dare to explore it and find a corridor. Proceeding cautiously I skulk toward the other end, uncertain of what I will find. The corridor is painted jet black and the single red bulb hanging from the ceiling barely lets me make out the edges of the passageway. Further along I find a door, also painted jet black, even the handle. I push it down and out; nothing happens. I push it down and in; the door opens.</p>

<p>I find myself in an alleyway outside the theatre. The smell in the air and the pools of water on the cobbled surface indicate it’s been raining. It’s getting dark; nearly time to perform.</p>

<p>Exiting the alley to the front of the theatre I make a turn and enter the theatre once more. Turning again I arrive at my home for the evening. I have a simple task as the show is sold out, so I settle in for a night of tearing tickets and wait for my ghostly audience to materialise.</p>
