description: Why is this here? Why is anything here?

This site is a place for [me](https://twitter.com/stut) to stretch my writing muscles.

I intend to use writing prompts from many different sources including books, the internet, and day-to-day events.
At the moment my primary source is a book called [642 Things To Write About](https://amzn.to/38t4ecm) as reading that is
what motivated me to begin.

Anything you find here may or may not be my opinion. I find it's often more rewarding to write about views I do not
hold so bear that in mind while reading.

I'm always interested in engaging on the subjects I write about and the best way to do that is on
<a href="https://twitter.com/stut" target="twitter">twitter</a>.

#### Why "Vadimus"?

[Vadimus means](https://www.latin-is-simple.com/en/vocabulary/search/?q=Vadimus) to _go_ or to _advance_. The reason I
chose it for this site is because it's intended to make me get going and advance my writing skills. Also because the
domain name was available.
