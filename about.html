<p>This site is a place for <a href="https://twitter.com/stut">me</a> to stretch my writing muscles.</p>

<p>I intend to use writing prompts from many different sources including books, the internet, and day-to-day events. At the moment my primary source is a book called <a href="https://amzn.to/38t4ecm">642 Things To Write About</a> as reading that is what motivated me to begin.</p>

<p>Anything you find here may or may not be my opinion. I find it’s often more rewarding to write about views I do not hold so bear that in mind while reading.</p>

<p>Anything you find here may or may not be based in fact. I find it can be equally rewarding to create stories as it is to recount them.</p>

<p>I’m always interested in engaging on the subjects I write about and the best way to do that is on <a href="https://twitter.com/stut" target="twitter">twitter</a>.</p>

<h4 id="why-vadimus">Why “Vadimus”?</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.latin-is-simple.com/en/vocabulary/search/?q=Vadimus">Vadimus means</a> to <em>go</em> or to <em>advance</em>. The reason I chose it for this site is because it’s intended to make me get going and advance my writing skills. Also because the domain name was available.</p>
