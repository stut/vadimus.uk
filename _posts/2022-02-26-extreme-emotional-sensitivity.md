I was just watching [an interview by Russell Howard with Jordan Peterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYM-sS-0-yg) and he mentioned something that really hit home.

It's well known that he went through a period of depression but I've never heard him describe it in so much detail in previous interviews. He speaks about how he was extremely sensitive to sensory inputs, to the point where he couldn't listen to music because it affected him so much. I immediately recognised this as something that changed in me after my friend Amber died in 2016. There are many more things that overwhelm me with emotion since that happened, from music to films to any depiction of people experiencing great joy.

The most recent example was something of a shock to me when it happened. I was perusing YouTube, following the recommendations wherever they took me, and I came across the video below.

Even looking up that embed code and seeing the first few seconds I could feel the emotion starting to overtake my body.
