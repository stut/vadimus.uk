## Moments of joy

As we go through life it's easy to glide past the many moments we experience without giving them a second thought, particularly those that are joy-filled nuggets of time. To get the most from these moments I've started making a list, and I'm hoping I'll be able to make this into a series of posts.

I'm currently in hospital being treated for pneumonia so many of this first batch come from that environment.

1. When you make someone laugh without thinking about what you were going to say or do before you'd said or done it.
1. The always cheery and giggly student nurse dispensing everyone's morning drugs.
1. Perfectly toasted toast and great butter in the morning.
1. Soaking buttered toast and tea in your mouth before swallowing.
1. Currys installers giving a reassuring air of competence.
1. Opening a new iPhone and admiring the thought that's gone into the packaging.
